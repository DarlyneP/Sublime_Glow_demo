# Sublime_Glow_demo
Welcome to the demo repository of the Sublime Glow Project!

I have been working on creating a website for an entreprise based in Africa in order for them to modernize their exchanges with their clientele.
The Website is done in freelance on a voluntary basis during my free time, it was a good opportunity for me to practice everything that I had learned in school during my 6 months program in which I learned web & mobile web development.

I started working on it in mid February of this year after I finished my 6 months program & have presented the website almost finished in front of the jury that evaluated me when I passed my Certification ("Titre Professionel DÃ©veloppeur Web & Web Mobile").
I have worked on this project in full autonomy, did the frontend, backend, wireframes, user stories, database management, server, authentication, everything.

The project isn't deployed yet & I have preferred keeping the repository private, but I figured out showcasing its advancement could be a good way to showcase my skills so here is a demo video that shows what the website looks like, & what can be done on it this far.

When the website is deployed its link will be added here so that you may see the actual, final product.

Demonstrations are presented from the most recent to the oldest so you'll have to scroll down in order to see the different stages of advancement.

You will also find the log (latest version) & the specifications at the end of this readme file. The log is also here for you to evaluate the actual pace at which this project is advancing considering that I am still in school at the moment meaning most of my time goes to my studies.
